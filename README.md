# Return-Calculator-Product-Feature-Proposal-

# Project Overview
This project focuses on the development of a Return Calculator feature proposal aimed at enhancing user engagement on Grip, an investment platform. The feature allows users to visualize the growth of their monthly investments over 1, 2, or 3 years by comparing various investment options available on the platform. The proposal includes key components such as investment comparisons, CAPM-adjusted returns, scenario simulation, and tax implication estimators.

# Key Features
* Investment Customization: Users can input monthly amounts, select timeframes, and choose from different investment products for comparison.
* Scenario Simulation: Visualizes best-case, moderate-case, and worst-case scenarios based on market trends, offering insights into potential risks and returns.
* Tax Implication Estimator: Calculates post-tax returns to provide users with a clear picture of their earnings.
* CAPM and Risk-Free Returns: Compares risk-adjusted returns across different investment options using CAPM.
  
# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
A detailed PRD was created, defining functional and technical requirements, including:

# Real-time data integration
* CAPM and risk-free return calculations
* Scenario simulations and tax calculations
* Scalability, security, and accuracy considerations
  
# Wireframe Design
Basic wireframes were developed in Figma to outline the user interface and interaction flow. Key elements include input fields for investment customization, interactive graphs for return visualizations, and side-by-side product comparisons.

# Conclusion
This proposal optimizes user experience by offering flexible investment choices, clear comparisons, and real-time insights, all while minimizing development complexity.
